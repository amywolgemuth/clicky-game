### Overview
For this assignment, I created a memory game with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions
Created a new React application using Create React App.

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if an image is clikced more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images on the page get shuffled in a random order.

After an incorrect guess, the user's score is reset and the game restarts.
